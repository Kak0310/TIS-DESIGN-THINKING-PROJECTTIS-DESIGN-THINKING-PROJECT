# 💡 SECP1513: Design Thinking Reflection - UTM Study Planner

## 📌 Project Overview
For this **Design Thinking** assignment, my team and I developed a proposal and a **Low Fidelity Prototype** for the **UTM Study Planner** app. This app is designed specifically for UTM students to manage their academic schedules more effectively.

### ✨ Key Features:
* **Smart Reminders:** Automatic notifications sent before classes start to ensure students never miss a lecture.
* **AI Feature:** An integrated AI assistant to help students prioritize tasks and answer academic queries.
* **Integrated Timetable:** A seamless sync with UTM's academic calendar.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 What I have gained from this assignment
* **User-Centric Mindset:** Through the Design Thinking process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test), I learned how to identify the real pain points of students, such as forgetfulness and task overload.
* **Prototyping Skills:** I gained experience in creating a **Low Fidelity Prototype**. This taught me that we don't need a finished product to test an idea; a simple sketch or wireframe is enough to gather valuable feedback.
* **AI Integration Concepts:** I explored how Artificial Intelligence can be practically applied in an educational tool to enhance productivity rather than just being a buzzword.

### 🚀 Suggestions for Improvement 
* **High-Fidelity Evolution:** In the future, I would like to transition this into a **High-Fidelity Prototype** using tools like Figma to test the actual user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
* **Broader User Testing:** I plan to conduct more testing sessions with a larger group of students from different faculties to see if the AI features meet their specific needs.
* **Offline Mode:** Adding an offline synchronization feature would be a great improvement for students who may have unstable internet connections in certain areas of the campus.
